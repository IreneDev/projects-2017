					In 1944 Hopper graduated and was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade. She served on <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #ff6a5a;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I" target="_blank">the Mark I computer</a> programming staff headed by Howard H. Aiken. Hopper and Aiken coauthored three papers on the Mark I, also known as <strong>the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator</strong>.

				<p>
					In 1949, Hopper became an employee of the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation for developing <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #ff6a5a;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I" target="_blank">the UNIVAC I</a>. She recommended that a new programming language be developed using entirely English words but it was not accepted for 3 years. By 1950s, when the company was taken over by the Remington Rand corporation her original compiler work was done and it was known as <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #ff6a5a;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-0_System" target="_blank">The A-0</a>.

					In 1959 Hopper served as a technical consultant (photo) to the committee that defined the new language <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #ff6a5a;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL" target="_blank">COBOL</a>. She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy. She also took over responsibility for standards testing of computer components and systems. Today these roles are carried out by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
